<p>The concept of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for managing pests, has remained in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in millions of hectares worldwide. Cold storage is likewise thought about a physical control and, although it does not always kill the insect pests, it at least stops their development and more feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production uses many of the same ideas as IPM but restricts the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to minimize the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
