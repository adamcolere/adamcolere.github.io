<p>Consider alternative approaches (besides pesticides) to make your home and garden unattractive to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a building. Current missions for efficient, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted mainly towards development of new and much better products with which to replace traditional harmful pesticides.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and determine them properly, so that proper control decisions can be made in combination with action thresholds. However, the major trend has been towards the use of modern-day chemistry and molecular biology to replace standard pesticides with less hazardous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based items; but these methods are still therapies.</p>
<p>To get more corn per acre, having a strong understanding of the level of pressure and kind of pests is essential for picking the best corn qualities and agronomic practices to deal with these difficulties. Even with all the knowledge about the pest and availability of resources for its reliable management, losses can be avoided just when corrective actions are taken at the right time.</p>
<p>Likewise, think about how the range of plants to be grown in the very same location may affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control relates to non-lethal methods too, such as keeping the area free and clean of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry ways such as cracks in walls or the space between the bottom of a door and the flooring. </p>
<p>And since pests behave differently even within a types, controlling them successfully requires unique knowledge of the pests themselves, in addition to ways to safely and efficientlymanage them. Important documents consist of a scope of service, pest activity reports, service reports, corrective action reports, trap design maps, lists of authorized pesticides, pesticide usage reports and applicator licenses.</p>
