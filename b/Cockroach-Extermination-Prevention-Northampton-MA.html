<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been advised as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al.

If your center currently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be surprised to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact products and services.</p>
