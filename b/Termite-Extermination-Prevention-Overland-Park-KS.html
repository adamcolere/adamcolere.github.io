If much of the pests are eliminated, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides need to be utilized as the last resort, in concept, sometimes they are the first line of defense to avoid the area-wide spread of specific endemic or intrusive pests and illness or to protect the seed and transplants from common and consistent pest problems.</p>
<p>Pest control is a very crucial step owing to the truth that a number of pests are providers of harmful disease-causing bacteria. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the obliteration of a few pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).
