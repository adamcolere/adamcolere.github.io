D's has actually been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control along with fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in farming resulting from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been suggested as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove due to the fact that growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement.
