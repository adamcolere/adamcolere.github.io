<p>This mix of IGRs can be reliable in preventing re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches. SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, may cause serious damage to structures, office furniture, specimens and artifacts. Applicators perform more complex jobs, have the ability to utilize a wider variety of pesticides, and may focus on a specific location of pest control.</p>
<p>Chemical insecticides were to be utilized in the way least disruptive to biological control. After handling a number of nationwide chain exterminators and being largely disappointed with the service, I relied on Terminators for help with pest issues at my place of business.
