<p>Likewise, think about how the range of plants to be grown in the exact same area might influence ease of pesticide applications and spread of illness. Pest control involves non-lethal techniques too, such as keeping the area clean and complimentary of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the space in between the bottom of the floor and a door.</p>
