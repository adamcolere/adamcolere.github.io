<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household bug pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost solely about decreasing pesticide usage. If all other incorporated pest management strategies are unable to keep an insect pest population below an economic limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is warranted.</p>
