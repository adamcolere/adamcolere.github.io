Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to minimize the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
<p>This technique of pest control has fallen out of favour in current years since fire eliminates useful insects in addition to the pests and can have an unfavorable impact on the soil.

<p>Pesticides are chosen and used in a way that minimizes their possible harm to individuals, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is more than likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in fact need based use of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing facility through the supply chain, in the ingredients or packaging, and the facility itself will draw in pests through food odours and lighting.</p>
