<p>Pest control is an incredibly crucial measure owing to the reality that a variety of pests are providers of damaging disease-causing microorganisms. Area-wide pest management was first promoted for the removal of a few pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006). While scents are nothing new to pest control-- pest control specialists regularly utilize pheromones traps as a means to keep an eye on pest populations-- adding them to insecticides is a new concept.</p>
