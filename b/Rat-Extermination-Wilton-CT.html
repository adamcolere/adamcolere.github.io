<p>Pick an effective management method that will have the least amount of effect on other living creatures and the environment if a pest or illness causes undesirable damage despite preventative efforts. Examples consist of cultivation of alternate hosts (e.g., weeds), crop rotation, choice of planting sites, trap crops, and changing the timing of planting or harvest.</p>
