If much of the pests are eliminated, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the hereditary basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides should be used as the last resort, in concept, sometimes they are the first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of certain endemic or intrusive pests and illness or to secure the seed and transplants from typical and consistent pest issues.</p>
