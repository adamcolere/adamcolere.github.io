<p>In recommendation to the principle of integrating the use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later widened to welcome coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>
