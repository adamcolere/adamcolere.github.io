<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with invasive pest issues, classical biological control technique is normally used where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been effectively used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
