<p>Part of this success came from field schools which permitted regional farmers to harness their indigenous knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997).

<h3>Benefits of Using A Pest Control Exterminator Garnerville NY</h3>
<p>Although multiple sources specify IPM in various methods, previous models primarily concentrated on the eco-friendly, and to some degree on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A current IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) determined a lack of a holistic IPM technique that utilizes both standard and modern tools.</p>
<p>This involves using other living things that are enemies of a pest in order to control it. In some cases, the term" biological control" has been used in a broad context to encompass a full spectrum of biological organisms and biologically based products consisting of pheromones, resistant plant varieties, and autocidal strategies such as sterile insects.</p>
