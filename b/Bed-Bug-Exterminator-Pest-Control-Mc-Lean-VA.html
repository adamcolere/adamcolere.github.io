With more regulations on pesticide use and a decrease in the variety of active ingredients in some crops, there is a greater emphasis on better understanding of offered control choices (Hillocks 2012 ). Regulative guidelines that limit making use of particular pesticides or promote making use of others can have a significant influence on IPM application.</p>
<p>In reference to the concept of integrating the use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to accept collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>A biological control program can succeed if these recommendations are followed: 1) properly identify all arthropod pests, 2) purchase natural opponents from a trustworthy biological control supplier, 3) ensure there is a consistent supply of high quality natural enemies, 4) stress that appropriate shipping procedures be followed, and 5) acquire directions from biological control providers on appropriate release rates and timing of application.</p>
