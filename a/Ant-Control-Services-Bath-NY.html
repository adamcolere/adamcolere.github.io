<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been suggested as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off since growers were not all set for such an intercropping arrangement. If your center presently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be shocked to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact products and services.</p>
