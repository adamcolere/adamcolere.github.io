<p>All at once, it is also based on semiochemicals particularly kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are driven away or prevented away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ). A lot of pesticide problems are caused by a little number of the pesticides available today. </p>
