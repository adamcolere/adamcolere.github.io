Insect pests cause substantial losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If fundamental house health is overlooked, the impacts of other types of pest control will be extremely temporary as the pests will soon be back, and in greater numbers.</p>
<p>For some jobs, pest control workers utilize a combination of pest management strategies, a practice called incorporated pest management.

Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and diseases, though challenged by some as a valid step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the augmentation of pest control.</p>
