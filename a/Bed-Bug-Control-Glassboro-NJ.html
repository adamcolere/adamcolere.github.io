<p>For some jobs, pest control workers utilize a combination of pest management strategies, a practice called incorporated pest management.

Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and diseases, though challenged by some as a valid step, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the augmentation of pest control.</p>
