Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about decreasing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management strategies are not able to keep an insect pest population below a financial limit, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is warranted.</p>
<p>IPM methods include both chemical and nonchemical means to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest effective dosage when other techniques of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that focuses on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of strategies such as biological control, environment control, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
