<p>Groundwater may become infected through heavy usage of pesticides. Bio-rational products, or pest control items that are reasonably non-toxic and have little unfavorable impact on the environment, are another step forward in sustainability and are ending up being significantly essential.

<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been recommended as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al.

On the other hand, pest control will include killing bugs, insects, rats, squirrels as required (in as humanely a fashion as possible).</p>
