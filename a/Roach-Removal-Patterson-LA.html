D's has actually been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control along with fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture resulting from an overuse of artificial pesticides.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been recommended as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off since growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan.
