<p>This technique describes using a range of physical or mechanical methods for pest exemption, trapping (in many cases comparable to the behavioral control), removal, or damage (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>They must also be detail-oriented in dealing with pesticides and chemicals that are possibly damaging. Learn more about Rentokil PCI's solutions for common pests in businesses and houses. The four significant problems encountered with standard pesticides are harmful residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest revival. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a strategy that avoids pest damage with minimum unfavorable influence on human health, the environment and non-target organisms.</p>
<p>The best method to control pests is to make your home unappealing to them. However home pests can also be a risk to your household. When trying to find a place to infest, pests choose to conceal in a place that provides food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is a lot easier to implement in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
<p>In Asia, various phases of IPM have been effectively adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997). </p>
<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal dosages of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience retarded development and feeding and go through higher parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). In other words, an effective, nondisruptive method to manage a moderate beet armyworm break out may be to retard its advancement and damage while providing the parasitoids time to work, therefore enhancing the parasitoids' impact during subsequent generations.</p>
