Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a holistic approach to sustainable crop security that concentrates on managing insects, weeds and diseases through a combination of cultural, physical, biological and chemical approaches that are cost efficient, socially acceptable and ecologically sound.</p>
<p>One ofthe biggest benefits of natural techniques is that they don't include using toxicchemicals. Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if offered; keep in mind, do not kill the beneficial insects. But the exterminators not just help you in getting rid of the pests from your home, but they make sure the pests will not return. IPM worries using non-chemical control approaches, such as exemption or trapping, prior to chemical options.</p>
