<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with invasive pest concerns, classical biological control method is usually used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has been effectively used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
<p>They thought that some qualities of area-wide management are incompatible with many standard IRM techniques, however recommended that usage of biologically based control methods, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, might add to both area-wide pest management and IRM. After executing any pest management strategy, inspect the sign plants to assess if arthropod pests have actually been eliminated and assess the efficiency and durability of control.</p>
