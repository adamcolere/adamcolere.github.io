<p>This approach refers to using a variety of physical or mechanical methods for pest exemption, trapping (sometimes comparable to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ).

<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a ecologically delicate and efficient method to pest management that depends on a combination of sensible practices. IPM is an approach to guarantee financial practicality at both consumer and producer level (seller is always anticipated to earn a profit), environmental security through a well balanced use of all readily available pest control choices, and social acceptability considering that IPM-based food is cost effective and safe.</p>
<p>Biological pest control steps make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary task is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and use controls where the limits are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural opponents helps to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even fix structural damage triggered by termites.</p>
<p>Tighter regulations for food safety, occupational health and wellness, and the environment imply internal pest control isn't an option for many food organisations these days. Farmers are confronted with myriad of production obstacles where the most typical issues are pests, that include weeds, illness, and insects. Likewise, pest and crop management disciplines need to collaborate to develop control recommendations that show these interactions. </p>
<p>The global estimates differ in magnitude, but it is believed around 25% of crops are lost to illness and pests, such as insects, fungis and other plant pathogens (FAO Crop Prospects and Food Scenario 2009). Applications of pesticides need to reach their designated targets. However there are a lot of pest control companies out there in Chandigarh and they all have different level of quality and service requirement, so naturally there charge differently.</p>
