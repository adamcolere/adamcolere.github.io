<p>In Asia, various phases of IPM have actually been successfully adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, vegetables), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, vegetables), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997). </p>
