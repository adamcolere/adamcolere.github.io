<p>In referral to the idea of integrating the use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on broadened to embrace collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess higher levels of resistance. </p>
<p>They thought that some attributes of area-wide management are incompatible with lots of conventional IRM strategies, but suggested that use of biologically based control techniques, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, may contribute to both area-wide pest management and IRM. After implementing any pest management technique, examine the indicator plants to evaluate if arthropod pests have been eliminated and assess the efficiency and durability of control.</p>
