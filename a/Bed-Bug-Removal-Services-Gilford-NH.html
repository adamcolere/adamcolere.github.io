<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control method is normally utilized where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has been successfully used against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
<p>Natural opponents can be effective, and pesticides (chemical compounds for managing pests) are just utilized when alternative choices do not produce the required outcome.
